# Medical Services Payment Data - Forecasting Analysis Summary

## Overview

This report summarizes the findings from the time series analysis and forecasting of the medical services payment data. The analysis focuses on trends, seasonal patterns, growth rates, and future payment projections.

## Key Findings

### Monthly Payment Trends

- The data shows a consistent overall upward trend in monthly payments from 2022 to 2023
- Total annual payments increased from ₽1,172,651,670.84 in 2022 to ₽1,375,219,466.56 in 2023
- Overall annual growth rate: **17.27%**

### Seasonal Patterns

- There are clear seasonal patterns in the payment data
- Higher payment volumes typically occur in:
  - March (spring season)
  - October-December (end of year)
- Lower payment volumes typically occur in:
  - January (beginning of year)
  - May-August (summer months)

### Year-over-Year Growth Analysis

- Average monthly growth rate: **17.91%**
- Median monthly growth rate: **17.87%**
- Growth rates varied significantly by month:
  - Highest growth in January: **35.31%**
  - Lowest growth in May: **2.22%**
- Most months showed double-digit growth rates

### Payment Forecasts

Our SARIMA model forecasts the following payment amounts for the first half of 2024:

| Month | Forecasted Amount (₽) |
|-------|----------------------|
| January 2024 | 122,476,294.72 |
| February 2024 | 127,982,011.79 |
| March 2024 | 151,236,638.86 |
| April 2024 | 143,232,339.41 |
| May 2024 | 125,828,955.81 |
| June 2024 | 133,120,228.00 |

The model predicts continued growth in the first half of 2024, with the highest payment volume expected in March 2024. The forecast maintains the seasonal pattern observed in previous years.

## Visualization Insights

### Time Series Decomposition

The time series decomposition revealed:

1. **Trend Component**: A strong upward trend throughout the analysis period
2. **Seasonal Component**: Consistent seasonal patterns with peaks in March and November
3. **Residual Component**: Some unexplained variability, particularly in the second half of 2023

### Projected Growth

- The SARIMA forecasting model projects continued growth in payment volumes
- The seasonal pattern is expected to continue in 2024
- The forecast includes upper and lower confidence intervals to account for uncertainty

## Business Implications

1. **Resource Planning**: Higher payment processing volumes can be anticipated during peak months (March and October-December), requiring adequate staffing and system capacity
2. **Financial Forecasting**: The projected payment amounts can be used for financial planning and cash flow management
3. **Service Expansion**: Growth trends suggest opportunities for service expansion in areas showing the strongest increases

## Methodology

The analysis employed the following techniques:

- Time series decomposition using an additive model with period=12
- SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model with parameters (1,1,1)×(1,1,1,12)
- Growth rate analysis comparing year-over-year and month-over-month changes

## Limitations and Considerations

- The forecasting model is based on 24 months of historical data, which may limit its long-term predictive accuracy
- External factors such as economic conditions, regulatory changes, and service fee adjustments are not explicitly incorporated into the model
- The forecasts should be periodically updated as new data becomes available

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Forecast Updates**: Update the forecasting model quarterly with new data
2. **Scenario Analysis**: Develop alternative forecasts based on different growth assumptions
3. **Service-Level Forecasting**: Consider developing forecasts for specific service types to identify growth opportunities
4. **Operational Alignment**: Adjust operational planning to account for seasonal patterns in payment volumes
